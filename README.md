# Automated Server Management and Monitoring System

Automated Server Management and Monitoring System is a web-based application that allows you to automate and monitor remote servers. The project consists of a PowerShell backend and a React frontend, providing a user-friendly interface for various server management tasks.

## Features

- Monitor remote servers for installed KBs, disk info, and services.
- Create snapshots for VMs with custom names and descriptions.
- Manage snapshots, including filtering, selection, and deletion.
- Monitor Citrix VDA servers, connected sessions, app deployment, and disk info.
- Copy files/folders to multiple remote machines simultaneously.
- User authentication using domain credentials.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `PS_Server` directory and run the PowerShell server.
   ```PS_Server
   # Example PowerShell commands
   cd PS_Server
   .\Server.ps1
   or QuickCheck_Server.exe
3. Access the web interface by opening your browser and going to `http://localhost:9097/`.

 ```
## Front End Development
1. Navigate to the `Quickcheck` directory and install frontend dependencies.
   ```bash
   # Example terminal commands
   cd Quickcheck
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the React frontend.
